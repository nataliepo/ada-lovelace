We mentioned the amazing <a href=\"http://www.typepad.com/site/blogs/6a00d834790a6569e200d834790a6a69e2/post/6a00d834790a6569e201156f444dda970b/edit\" target=\"_blank\">Heddy Lamarr</a>, who managed to be a Hollywood star, and to have discovered something so fundamental to our lives now. Our last years entry is here.</p><p>As they say, and I do agree &quot;because because women need to see female role models more than men need to see male ones&quot;</p><p>There are still too few women in conferences, too few examples of women who have managed to be acknowledged for their work, or their contributions.

A lei spetta il merito, solo in minima parte riconosciuto dalla storia della scienza e tecnologia scritta da menti maschili, di avere gettato,&#0160;nella prima metà dell&#39;800, le basi della programmazione informatica e quindi, molto indirettamente, di permettere a noi di essere qui stamattina a picchiare sulla tastiera per&#0160;lanciare i nostri pensieri e i nostri tweet nel blogospazio. In mezzo, tra&#0160;il qui e ora e&#0160;il sistemino di perforazione che Lady Ada, appassionata di ricamo, scommesse sui cavalli&#0160;e matematica, inventò per fare meno fatica a lavorare con il telaietto nel suo salottino vittoriano, c&#39;è tutta la storia dei computer, dell&#39;Information technology e di altre immense cose di cui noi donne - che si sa, siamo minimaliste&#0160; per natura e use a&#0160;darci piccoli obbiettivi - non rivendichiamo la paternità, o meglio la maternità. <br />In effetti l&#39;altro grande merito di Ada Lovelace fu quello di aver capito&#0160;subito che i computer erano molto di più che una scatola per fare i conti, altra visione prettamente maschile e rivelatasi inesatta.<br />Il 24 marzo in Internet&#0160;è l&#39;Ada Lovelace day, giorno in cui su tutta la Rete blog, twitter, siti&#0160;si scrive, disegna, posta e&#0160;tweetta per attrarre l&#39;attenzione sul contributo mai abbastanza riconosciuto delle donne al progresso della scienza e della tecnologia. JobTalk c&#39;è. Il sito ufficiale&#0160;è <a href=\"http://findingada.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Findingada.com</a> che ha anche il suo bravo <a href=\"http://blog.findingada.com/\" target=\"_blank\">blog.</a> Lì si può sapere tutto di Ada, per esempio che scrisse programmi per Charles Babbage padre, riconosciutissimo invece,&#0160;delle macchine da elaborazione antenate del computer, e anche che fu proprio lei a&#0160;mettere giù la prima descrizione sensata di computer e di software.&#0160;&#0160;Su Twitter&#0160;&#0160;l&#39; hashtag&#0160;dell&#39;Ada Lovelace Day è &#0160;<a class=\"tweet-url hashtag\" href=\"http://www.typepad.com/search?q=%23ald10\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"#ald10\"><font color=\"#2276bb\">#ald10</font></a>&#0160;.<a href=\"http://jobtalk.blog.ilsole24ore.com/.a/6a00e54eda81ae88330120a96eb49f970b-popup\" onclick=\"window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false\" style=\"FLOAT: right\"></a> <a href=\"http://jobtalk.blog.ilsole24ore.com/.a/6a00e54eda81ae88330120a96eb634970b-popup\" onclick=\"window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false\" style=\"FLOAT: right\"><img alt=\"Computer-engineer-barbie\" class=\"asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e54eda81ae88330120a96eb634970b \" src=\"http://jobtalk.blog.ilsole24ore.com/.a/6a00e54eda81ae88330120a96eb634970b-150wi\" style=\"MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px; WIDTH: 150px\" /></a> <br />&#0160;In tono con la giornata, la notizia che in un sondaggio popolare che ha coinvolto mezzo&#0160;milione di votanti, <a href=\"http://jobtalk.blog.ilsole24ore.com/.a/6a00e54eda81ae88330120a96eb5b0970b-popup\" onclick=\"window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false\" style=\"FLOAT: left\"></a><a href=\"http://mashable.com/2010/03/09/computer-engineer-barbie/\" target=\"_blank\">sul nuovo futuro professionale della bambola Barbie </a>- &quot;labarbie&quot;per noi bambine del secolo scorso - molto consenso ma anche acceso dibattito ha suscitato la&#0160;proposta della Barbie programmatrice, o Coder Barbie, con il computer rosa, la scritta Barbie in codice binario sulla t shirt e gli occhialetti fluo come quelli della ministra Gelmini.

Scenes of forest destruction, forest harvesting and forest fragmentation, thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has when it is not disturbed by humans.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nalininadkarni.com/\">http://www.nalininadkarni.com/</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><object height=\"326\" width=\"446\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"bgColor\" value=\"#ffffff\" /> <param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/dynamic/NaliniNadkarni_2009-medium.flv&amp;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/NaliniNadkarni-2009.embed_thumbnail.jpg&amp;vw=432&amp;vh=240&amp;ap=0&amp;ti=476&amp;introDuration=16500&amp;adDuration=4000&amp;postAdDuration=2000&amp;adKeys=talk=nalini_nadkani_on_conserving_the_canopy;year=2009;theme=the_rise_of_collaboration;theme=inspired_by_nature;theme=a_greener_future;event=TED2009;&amp;preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;\" /><embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" flashvars=\"vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/dynamic/NaliniNadkarni_2009-medium.flv&amp;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/NaliniNadkarni-2009.embed_thumbnail.jpg&amp;vw=432&amp;vh=240&amp;ap=0&amp;ti=476&amp;introDuration=16500&amp;adDuration=4000&amp;postAdDuration=2000&amp;adKeys=talk=nalini_nadkani_on_conserving_the_canopy;year=2009;theme=the_rise_of_collaboration;theme=inspired_by_nature;theme=a_greener_future;event=TED2009;\" height=\"326\" pluginspace=\"http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" src=\"http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"446\" wmode=\"transparent\" /></object></p>",
